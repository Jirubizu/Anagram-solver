# Anagram Solver C++

## Purpose

This started of as a university project but I figured I would try to make this more sophisticated and try to see how well I can adapt in C++.

This project is allowing me to see different ways to solve problems but also find ways to maintain a high standard of code.

## Build instructions

```bash
git clone RepoURL
cd Anagram-solver-master
cmake
```
